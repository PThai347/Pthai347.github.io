              Conventions:<br>
              I love going to conventions.<br>
              There is so much to do and so much to see, it is always a great place to meet new people.<br>
              Having gone to so many of them I would say that my favorite one would be Pax East hosted in Boston Massachusetts.<br>
              The reason is that  it is close to and it is about one of my other bigger interest which is videogames.

            <h3>Videogames</h3>
                To me videogames is more than just a game. To me it is art.<br>
                Much like how movies can be considered works of art so to can videogames.<br>
                There are bad videogames but there are also bad movies. Great videogames however can let you experience things you normally would not have.<br>
                My top three choice for videogames are:<br>
                <ol>
                  <li>The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt. A great game with lots of depth and a rich cast of characters, along side a captivating story.</li>
                  <li>Halo 3. The greatest shooter game of all time. Great multiplayer, intriguing single player story. A great game to play with freinds</li>
                  <li> Borderlands 2. This game was the game I spent my highschool years playing. So much replayability. A fun game to lose tack of time to.</li>
                </ol>
            <h3>Outdoors</h3>
            Despite the two things listed above I do enjoy the great outdoors<br>
            I prefer camping and sitting around the campfire over other activities<br>
            To me there is just something about  sitting around an open flame. Enojoying food and drinks that calms the soul.<br>
            I have found that Acadia National forest is the best place to go camping. Its remote with a great scenice view all around.<br>
